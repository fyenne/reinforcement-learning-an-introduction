# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
### by _Richard Sutton_ & _Andrew Barto_ (2nd edition)

> Swift for TensorFlow was an experiment in the next-generation platform for machine learning, incorporating the latest research across machine learning, compilers, differentiable programming, systems design, and beyond. It was archived in February 2021.

## Solutions to Exercises and Programming Problems

This branch contains an "experimental" version of the repository written in Swift. The programming problems use [DeepMind's OpenSpiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/) as the API between the agent and the game. So checking the [documentation](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) may help to get a faster start.

The code is written in [Swift 5](https://swift.org) and uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/guide/overview?hl=nl) library for vectorized linear algebra operations.
